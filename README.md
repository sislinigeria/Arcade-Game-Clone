## Requirements

To achieve this game, I had to breakdown the steps of the things I needed to do. Which includes the following;
* I already have the HTML structure, the game engine, resources and images. All this was provided by Udacity.
* Game should have the ability to render the tiles, enemies and the player inside the canvas.
* Game should be able to restrict the movement of the player only within the canvas and the enemies to move out and back into the canvas (Screen) randomizing it's speed rate.
* Use an `if` to return the player to the starting position any time it collide with an enemy.
* Implement the arrow keys to work and also set the length of each tile for the player character to move.
* In summary I tried to maintain the specifications stated on the project rubrics
    * Player can not move off screen
    * Vehicles cross the screen
    * Vehicle-player collisions happen logically (not too early or too late)
    * Vehicle-player collision resets the game
    * Something happens when player wins - game restart/player returns to the start position.

The objective of the game is to move the queen to the water without colliding with the enemies.

* Use the **Down Arrow** key to move the queen (Player) down one tile at a time
* Use the **Left Arrow** key to move to the left side of the screen one tile at a time
* Use the **Right Arrow** key to move to the right side of the screen one tile at a time.

Move the queen to the water, avoid colliding with the enemies.
