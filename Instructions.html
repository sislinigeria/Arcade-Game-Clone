            <li><strong>Description</strong>
                <br>Frogger is a classic arcade game, developed by Konami in 1981. The objective of the game is for the player to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. The player can move left, right, up and down using the arrow keys on the keyboard.
                <p>The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the screen. Once the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start position. Once the player reaches the water (top) the game is won.</p></li>
